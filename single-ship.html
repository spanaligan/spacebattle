        <h1> Welcome Captain!</h1>
        <h2> Emergency news bulletin... </h2>
        <p> Earth has been attacked by a Mother-ship full of aliens!
            You are the captain of the USS Schwarzenegger, on a mission to destroy every last alien.</p>

        <p>Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers, but you must take out the Mother-ship's
            weapons before you can do any damage to the Mother-ship itself.</p>

        <p> Fortunately, the aliens haven't spotted your ship yet, so you have the element of
            surprise. Use that initiative to attack first.
            However, if the battle proves too dangerous, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.</p>

        <p> Best of luck captain as you complete your quest to destroy the aliens!!!</p>
